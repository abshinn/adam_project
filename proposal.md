Donors Choose Project Proposal
==============================

Adam Shinn __July 4th, 2014__

#### Supply gap modeling
- One way to define project-supply-gap: period without any projects for a given school
- Possible gap metric: Projects per month (or year) for a given school or district

#### Ideas
- Which projects are most sucessful in areas with the highest poverty, and how does it compare to areas with little to no poverty?
- Perform topic modeling on DonorsChoose project proposals to find phrases which are most successful.
- Obtain school district revanues and state budget data, categorically describe schools by income need.
- Compare distribution of essesntial versus enrichment projects from location to location.

### High-level description

[Donors Choose](http://donorschoose.org) is an organization that enables educators to crowdsource funds for classroom projects, helping to provide essential and enriching classroom projects for students all over the country. The overaching goal of the project is to help provide insight and guidance to Donors Choose so that they may most effectively focus their resources on guiding teachers to create successfully-funded projects.

### How are you presenting your work?

In depth analysis will be presented in a well-formatted ipython notebook, and will be available on github. Additionally, I would like to visualize a subset of the findings in an interactive javascript D3 visualization.

### What is your next step?

</br>

### What are your data sources?

DonorsChoose internal database, historical DonorsChoose data, as well as census and regional governmental data.

## __From Zipfian Proposal Repo__:

#### Preliminary-proposal

Preliminary proposals serve to oraganize all of your initial ideas and will allow us to provide feedback on each of them before you narrow it down to one... and it is always great to have backups!

Please follow the following template for your project proposals:

1. Name, Date.
2. High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?
3. How are you presenting your work? (web app, visualization, presentation/slides, etc.)
4. Whats your next step?
5. What are your data sources? 

#### Final Proposal
For the final proposal, you will pick one of your initial ideas and elaborate on it.  In addition to everything listed in the preliminary proposal, please add the following:

1. Describe your techniques: break the data pipeline into portions and describe each one.
2. Can you anticipate problems, what are they, do you need to overcome them now? How do you overcome them?
3. How far do you anticipate to take the project in the allotted time frame? 
4. Any other repos, libraries and other tools that you're considering using? Are you citing them? Are you acknowledging them for their contribution?
5. Do you have the dataset already? If not, what is involved in obtaining it?
