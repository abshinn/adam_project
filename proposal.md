#### Preliminary-proposal

Preliminary proposals serve to oraganize all of your initial ideas and will allow us to provide feedback on each of them before you narrow it down to one... and it is always great to have backups!

Please follow the following template for your project proposals:

1. Name, Date.
2. High level description of the project: what question or problem are you addressing?
3. How are you presenting your work? (web app, visualization, presentation/slides, etc.)
4. Whats your next step?
5. What are your data sources? 

#### Final Proposal
For the final proposal, you will pick one of your initial ideas and elaborate on it.  In addition to everything listed in the preliminary proposal, please add the following:

1. Describe your techniques: break the data pipeline into portions and describe each one.
2. Can you anticipate problems, what are they, do you need to overcome them now? How do you overcome them?
3. How far do you anticipate to take the project in the allotted time frame? 
4. Any other repos, libraries and other tools that you're considering using? Are you citing them? Are you acknowledging them for their contribution?
5. Do you have the dataset already? If not, what is involved in obtaining it?
