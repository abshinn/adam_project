The purpose of this project is to determine which school districts can most benefit from DonorsChoose by comparing their financial, demographic, and ecomomic similarity to the most active DonorsChoose schools.

#### Data

Data sources used include DonorsChoose project data from their thirteen year history, education revenue data the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), and district-level demographic and econmic census data.
